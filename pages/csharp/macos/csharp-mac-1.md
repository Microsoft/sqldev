## Step 1.2 Install .NET Core

If you already have .NET Core installed on your machine, skip this step.

Install .NET Core by downloading the **[official installer](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/787e81f1-f0da-4e3b-a989-8a199132ed8c/61a8dba81fbf2b3d533562d7b96443ec/dotnet-sdk-3.1.100-osx-x64.pkg)**. This installer will install the tools and put them on your PATH so you can run dotnet from the Console.

> You have successfully installed .NET Core on your Mac. You now have everything you need to start writing your C# apps with SQL Server!
